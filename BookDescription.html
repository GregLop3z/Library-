          Twice as Hard: The Stories of Black Women Who Fought to <br />

          <h4>
            <strong>
              Black women physicians’ stories have gone untold for far too long,
              leaving gaping holes in American <br />
              medical history, in women’s history, and in black history. It’s
              time to set the record straight.
            </strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            No real account of black women physicians in the US exists, and what
            little <br />
            mention is made of these women in existing histories is often
            insubstantial or <br />
            altogether incorrect. In this work of extensive research, Jasmine
            Brown offers a <br />
            rich new perspective, penning the long-erased stories of nine
            pioneering black <br />
            women physicians beginning in 1860, when a black woman first entered
            <br />
            medical school. Brown champions these black women physicians,
            including <br />
            stories of:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler</strong>, who graduated from
            medical school only fourteen <br />
            months after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed and provided
            medical <br />
            care for the newly freed slaves who had been neglected and exploited
            <br />
            by the medical system and many more.
